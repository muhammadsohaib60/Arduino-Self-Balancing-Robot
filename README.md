# Arduino-Self-Balancing-Robot

I'll show you how to build a small
self-balancing robot that can move around avoiding
obstacles. This is a tiny robot measuring 4 inches
wide and 4 inches tall and is based on the Arduino
Pro Mini development board and the MPU6050
accelerometer-gyroscope module.
In the steps that follow, we will see how to interface
the MPU6050 with Arduino, how to measure the
angle of inclination of the robot, how to use PID to
make the robot stay balanced. An ultrasonic
rangefinder is also added to the robot which prevents
it from banging into obstacles as it wanders around.
