# Arduino-Self-Balancing-Robot
I'll appear you how to construct a little self-balancing robot that can move around maintaining a strategic distance from impediments. Typically a little robot measuring 4 inches wide and 4 inches tall and is based on the Arduino Professional Smaller than expected development board and the MPU6050 accelerometer-gyroscope module. Within the steps that take after, we'll see how to interface the MPU6050 with Arduino, how to degree the point of inclination of the robot, how to utilize PID to create the robot remain adjusted. An ultrasonic rangefinder is additionally added to the robot which anticipates it from slamming into impediments because it meanders around.
** I bought most of these parts from aliexpress but you'll be able discover them in any other hardware store as well **

1. Arduino Pro Mini

2. GY-521 module with MPU-6050

3. DRV8833 Pololu motor driver

4. 2, 5V boost converter

5. US-020 ultrasonic distance sensor

6. NCR18650 battery and holder

7. Pair of micro metal gear motors (N20, 6V, 200 rpm) and brackets

8. Pair of 42x19mm wheels

9. 3, Double-sided prototype PCB (4cm x 6cm)

10. 8, 25cm Nylon spacers and 4, nylon nuts

Apart from the above, you will need some cables, berg connectors and one on/off switch.
