# Arduino-Self-Balancing-Robot

I'll show you how to build a small
self-balancing robot that can move around avoiding
obstacles. This is a tiny robot measuring 4 inches
wide and 4 inches tall and is based on the Arduino
Pro Mini development board and the MPU6050
accelerometer-gyroscope module.
In the steps that follow, we will see how to interface
the MPU6050 with Arduino, how to measure the
angle of inclination of the robot, how to use PID to
make the robot stay balanced. An ultrasonic
rangefinder is also added to the robot which prevents
it from banging into obstacles as it wanders around.

I bought most of these parts from aliexpress but you can find them in any other electronics store as well.

1. Arduino Pro Mini

2. GY-521 module with MPU-6050

3. DRV8833 Pololu motor driver

4. 2, 5V boost converter

5. US-020 ultrasonic distance sensor

6. NCR18650 battery and holder

7. Pair of micro metal gear motors (N20, 6V, 200 rpm) and brackets

8. Pair of 42x19mm wheels

9. 3, Double-sided prototype PCB (4cm x 6cm)

10. 8, 25cm Nylon spacers and 4, nylon nuts

Apart from the above, you will need some cables, berg connectors and one on/off switch.
